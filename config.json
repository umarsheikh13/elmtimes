It was the first mosque to be given by Tower Hamlets Council to the residents to run as a place of worship along with community activities. Since then the once known residential flats has been transformed into a well loved place of worship and community centre. It has gone through many stages of development and extensions to keep up to date with the local residential and estate modernisation to accommodate the needs of the local people. Please donate to raise funds for the latest development and extension of the mosque.</p> <p>Donation link for the Extension Plan at Coventry Cross Mosque: <a href='https://www.muslimgiving.org/Coventrycross' target='_blank'>https://www.muslimgiving.org/Coventrycross</a></p> <p>Coventry Cross Mosque,<br> 6 Broxbourne House<br> Empson Street, London E3 3LJ</p> <p>Nearest Stations: Devons Road DLR & Bromley By Bow Station</p> <p>Jummah Winter Time: 13.00<br> Jummah Summer Time 13.30</p> <p class='video'> <iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8fHVJm7Nfy8' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe></p>",
